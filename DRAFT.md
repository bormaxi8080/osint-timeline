AI-Assisted Analysis of War-Related Content on Grey Zone Domains.

Since the beginning of the illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine, [Rolf Fredheim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rfredheim/), [Elsa Isaksson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elsa-isaksson-a94222149/) & [James Pamment](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-pamment-06aa2021/) have been tracking how videos of atrocities make it from fringe channels, via aggregators, to mainstream social media.  
  
To aid with this work, we created a simple LLM web-scraper and analytical tool designed to shield the researcher from the content. This working paper describes the murky online environment that this type of content is seeded to, explains how the tool works, and runs tests to show how reliable we could make it. Potential applications in the world of content moderation, policing, and intelligence analysis are obvious - but what we really wanted to demonstrate here is how cheap, quick, and (relatively) easy it can be to create such tools:
