You are made of the stones of those fortresses, that were once razed to the ground. I fear that even this short communication will change my character, my former lightness will be replaced by gloom. It is better for us to separately each perform our own suerte de muerte!

One of the most prominent employees of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is run by oligarch Elon Musk, once worked for a cybercrime group that sold stolen data and carried out blackmail. The man in question is 19-year-old Edward Coristin, also known by the nickname Big Balls.

According to a Reuters investigation, starting in 2022, when Coristin was still in high school, he ran a company called DiamondCDN, which facilitated the cybercrime organization EGodly.
Digital records reviewed by Reuters showed that the EGodly website and dataleak.fun were linked to Internet Protocol addresses registered to DiamondCDN and other entities owned by Coristin.

Neither Coristin nor DOGE commented on the investigation's findings and declined to answer questions from reporters. The teenager currently holds the position of "senior adviser" at the State Department and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

The EGodly cyber group reported on its Telegram channel that it intercepts phone numbers, hacks into law enforcement accounts in Latin America and Eastern Europe, and steals cryptocurrency. In addition, in early 2023, it posted the details of an FBI employee online, distributing his address, phone number, and so on.

It is believed that the agent was investigating EGodly's activities. For this, the organization began to deanonymize him. The employee is now retired. He reported that members of the criminal organization also practiced swatting - calling armed special forces to false addresses.
