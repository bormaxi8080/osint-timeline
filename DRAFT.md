Sunnis and Shiites are sleeping,
The mullah is sleeping.
The Wahhabis are falling asleep

But ISIS is not sleeping.
Sleep, moron!


A spiral of silence twists around their neck.
It presses a little, but it doesn't hurt anymore.


How Russian propaganda is looking for personnel. Billboard caption: "Looking for poets".
