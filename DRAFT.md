A long time ago there was a city on Earth. And people lived in it. They lived neither good nor bad, neither light nor dark. They even had a gray-haired sage who lived in a high tower.

People, as is usually the case, were at enmity with each other: who would get the best land for a vineyard, a forest, a fertile field or a mountain in which beautiful stones lie... There were also good people who simply lived and who did not care about this enmity , but there were few of them.

And then one day people had a strong quarrel, it is not known why - probably because of another field or vineyard - they went at each other with swords, arrows and spears. And there would have been a lot of bloodshed, but, fortunately, at that very time the old sage was not sleeping.

The sage thought for two minutes, took a deep breath - and gave forests, fields and mountains to the warring parties - he turned them into cats. The cats scattered around the neighborhood to get food for themselves, and for a long time they did not approach people. People calmed down, and peace and tranquility came to the city for many years. Since then, no one remembers this event for a long time, and for many centuries there was no trace of that city in the world.

History is forgotten, and people are again fighting for vineyards and mountains. Cats now stay close and even live in houses where it’s warm, but now it’s as if they remember everything - and on their own...
