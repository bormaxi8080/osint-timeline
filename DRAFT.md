Siberian birds chirp in February: there will be enough warmth for the next chirp! You need to keep warm.

And the Almaty birds are screaming and choking in the morning: it’s already spring, and there will definitely be enough for the next Kazakh chiryk! And then the snow will fall again, and you will have to shut up and be silent for another moment. So that later you can tweet again, with a new Miau Mai May pressure! Live with new strength. How else?..
