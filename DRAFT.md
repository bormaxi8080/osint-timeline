More than anything in the world, the procurator hated the smell of rose oil, and everything now foreshadowed a bad day, since this smell began to haunt the procurator from dawn. It seemed to the procurator that the cypresses and palms in the garden emitted a rose scent, that the accursed rose stream was mixed with the smell of leather and the convoy. From the wings in the rear of the palace, where the first cohort of the twelfth lightning legion, which had arrived with the procurator in Yershalaim, was stationed, smoke was carried into the colonnade through the upper platform of the garden, and the bitter smoke, testifying to the fact that the cooks in the centuries had begun to prepare dinner, was mixed with the same greasy rose spirit. Oh gods, gods, why are you punishing me?..
