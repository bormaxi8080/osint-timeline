There are pillow people. Soft and warm when you are with them, but... without shape. Without bright thoughts, aspirations and ideas. And there are blade people, sharp and light. Those who move and move forward. The difference is always noticeable. Both of them depend: the first - on those whom they managed to tie to themselves, the second - on the light that is around. From the buzz mixed with pain that life constantly gives.
