The black market of drugs and precursors is something really special. Ilya Shumanov contributed as an investigator to a new BBC investigation exposing how chemical precursors from China reach the Russian market and are used for industrial production of mephedrone distributed through darkweb. He traced key routes through Vladivostok and Kazakhstan, documented nearly a ton of seized precursors, and identified typical masking tactics — from false customs declarations to re-registration via shell companies. The findings show that flows remain industrial in scale, while authorities deliberately look the other way: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5wajKa4iz8&feature=youtu.be
