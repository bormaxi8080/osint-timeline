Lived-were in a cloud of a point:
Dots-daughters and sons
Seven hundred thousand sons
Twenty hundred thousand daughters
Seven hundred thousand black dots
Sons and dot-daughters
Black hail spilled
And they went underground.


All that will remain of us is organic matter, lymph, mixed with broken glass.
