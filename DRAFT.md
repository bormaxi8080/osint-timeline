Sunnis and Shiites are sleeping,
The mullah is sleeping.
The Wahhabis are falling asleep
(Inshallah!)
Even Assad is going to bed,
So that we can dream about him at night,
But ISIS is not sleeping.
Sleep, moron!


A spiral of silence twists around their neck.
It presses a little, but it doesn't hurt anymore.


How Russian propaganda is looking for personnel. Billboard caption: "Looking for poets".
