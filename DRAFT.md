# Timeline Summarized Draft

Dystopia.

A team of workers catches chickens at night. The work is brought to the farm in the evening; after dark, a couple thousand chickens need to be caught and loaded into trucks. The chickens are caught in the dark and stuffed into iron crates. Naturally, they resist, trying to escape, scratching the catchers. But the shadows in the night are diligent and merciless. By morning, the pen is empty, and young chickens are released into it. During the day, the catchers drink heavily, but not out of pity for the unfortunate chickens headed for slaughter. But simply out of boredom...

**witr** exists to answer a single question:

> **Why is this running?**

When something is running on a system—whether it is a process, a service, or something bound to a port—there is always a cause. That cause is often indirect, non-obvious, or spread across multiple layers such as supervisors, containers, services, or shells.

Existing tools (`ps`, `top`, `lsof`, `ss`, `systemctl`, `docker ps`) expose state and metadata. They show _what_ is running, but leave the user to infer _why_ by manually correlating outputs across tools.

**witr** makes that causality explicit.

It explains **where a running thing came from**, **how it was started**, and **what chain of systems is responsible for it existing right now**, in a single, human-readable output.
