Hacking Nuclear Reactors using eBay and reverse engineering: cyber-physical attacks on Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). 
  
Security researcher Ruben Santamarta shared his fundamental (and one-of-a-kind) research on the cybersecurity of nuclear power plants a few months ago - 138 pages of scary but fascinating findings.  
  
As the author wrote, the analysis and the security issues described are purely hypothetical - because it's a nuclear reactor! The mind-blowing fact for me was that someone can buy nuclear plant equipment on eBay. Crazy - and quite alarming.  
  
Please enjoy the read and spread the word - offensive security research has officially come to nuclear plants.

LogonTracer: Visualizes Suspicious Activities. 
  
Who logged into the network and how? A single logon event can provide critical insights into the timeline of an attack, but without the right tools, connecting the dots is a challenge.  
  
LogonTracer makes this process easier by analyzing Windows Active Directory event logs and visualizing them as graphs. This allows security teams to identify patterns quickly.  
  
Whether it's a series of failed logins or unusual authentication requests:  
  
• Visualize logon data with Neo4j & Cytoscape  
• Install with Docker for easy setup  
• Detailed event log analysis in chronological order  
• Use advanced algorithms to pinpoint suspicious activity

FakeSNI. 

A program for bypassing blocking by modifying the SNI field in the TLS protocol.

Currently, most Russian providers have switched to using DPI filters. In the case of connections via the HTTPS protocol, almost all exchange with the remote server is encrypted. To determine the recipient, the filter has access to two connection parameters: the IP address and the ServerName field in the ClientHello request. For a number of reasons, filtering by IP address does not work well in practice, so ServerName is usually checked as a more reliable method. Modern browsers always add SNI and, accordingly, openly send ServerName.

However, the TLS 1.2 protocol allows not adding SNI to the client request at all.

In this case, the server must assume a connection to one of the served sites by default. All provider filters tested by the author currently allow requests with missing SNI. Sometimes it is possible to send a fake value for better disguise.

Unfortunately, it is impossible to remove or replace SNI by changing browser settings, even with the help of extensions. This program communicates with the site via connections initialized by ClientHello with a fake ServerName value.
In order to be able to view pages, the program locally starts a web server that relays responses. Thus, the browser can communicate with the site via the address http://127.0.0.1:10000/
