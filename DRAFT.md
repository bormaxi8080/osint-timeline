A spiral of silence twists around their neck.
It presses a little, but it doesn't hurt anymore.


This white bird of God,
flying by in a light sleep,
is marked by man and hell:
with a black oil stain.
Expecting nothing from us,
but answering for our sins,
here it is,
here it is,
here it is,
blackened by our stain.


How Russian propaganda is looking for personnel. Billboard caption: "Looking for poets".


"The day you get a cat, you become immortal. You can no longer die".
