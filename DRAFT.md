The melancholy of an ungrown apple


Plantain is a thing from childhood.


the sidhis launched missiles
the cardinals did not choose a pope
the houris laughed joyfully
the kami sighed
the priest got drunk
the Buddha cried
the shaman was injected with haloperidol
Oh, Gods! Gods!
the procurator is suffering from headaches
Yeshua smiled
Yershalaim burned
