...High in the mountains there is an Air Lake. The water in it is like a white dream - clean, transparent and cold. The bottom is not visible - only last year's brown leaves on the stones leading into the depths, a reflection of the past rain, a rainbow on the surface and three hundred year old cedars along the banks.
The lake is silent. Anyone who decides to swim in it becomes a child for a few minutes. So the Lake teaches people to laugh. The more good a person has done for others, the funnier and easier it is for him.

...Sitting in a small train station, you can only see the lights: orange, red and blue. And more cars from the highway shine with searchlights headlights on the turn. By impoverishing our language on purpose, we enrich it. Because there are no words to express this simplicity and complexity at the same time. And I wouldn't complicate things if it were really simple. Now the commodity will rumble past, pass by - and everything will end. So life will fly by like a freight train. You are either a cargo, or a driver, or at a stop. But it's more fun with flashlights. In a certain sense.



...The streets are being washed. Everything is flowering. Spring. Pigeons flock. Ahead is a Muslim woman, with a stroller, all in black, black scarf, black hijab. A girl in a pink stroller. And behind me, in front of me, a boy of about four, lagged behind, runs to his mother and screams: - Mother! Mommy!..
