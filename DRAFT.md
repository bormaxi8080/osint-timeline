A spiral of silence twists around their neck.
It presses a little, but it doesn't hurt anymore.


This white bird of God,
flying by in a light sleep,
is marked by man and hell:
with a black oil stain.
Expecting nothing from us,
but answering for our sins,
here it is,
here it is,
here it is,
blackened by our stain.


"The day you get a cat, you become immortal. You can no longer die".
