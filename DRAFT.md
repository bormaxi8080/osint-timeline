Something went wrong, not according to plan, and the gods no longer want to return to Earth.


When the Israelites, led by Moses, began to grumble against God during their wanderings in the desert, God sent poisonous snakes to attack them.

Anyone who was bitten by a snake and looked at the copper snake survived.
