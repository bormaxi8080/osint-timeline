...High in the mountains there is an Air Lake. The water in it is like a white dream - clean, transparent and cold. The bottom is not visible - only last year's brown leaves on the stones leading into the depths, a reflection of the past rain, a rainbow on the surface and three hundred year old cedars along the banks.
The lake is silent. Anyone who decides to swim in it becomes a child for a few minutes. So the Lake teaches people to laugh. The more good a person has done for others, the funnier and easier it is for him.
