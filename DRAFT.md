Some things are not random at all.

In 2016 I got a medical tattoo. Any doctor knows about this: your blood type is written on your shoulder and information is indicated that you do not mind being a donor of your organs. Well, if anything...

I don't know why I did it. I didn’t have any premonition, I just decided to do it for some reason and that’s all. Besides, she is also beautiful)

But when I was stabbed in the stomach by a deputy, already on the operating table the doctor wanted to test my blood type: I needed an urgent transfusion. I just showed him the tattoo on my shoulder, and he didn’t do the analysis right away, wait and waste time. Perhaps this saved me. At least in particular.

The doctor was Kazakh, by the way.

I believe in such things. Not by chance and in general.
