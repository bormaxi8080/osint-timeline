I'm like a chronicle. I'm like Chthon. I've always been like this. Serebryansky forest. Verdun. Tin cans with nails. Optical fiber getting into flour.


Living in a society poisoned by propaganda, sooner or later everyone will become infected.

Hacking Nuclear Reactors using eBay and reverse engineering: cyber-physical attacks on Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). 
  
Security researcher Ruben Santamarta shared his fundamental (and one-of-a-kind) research on the cybersecurity of nuclear power plants a few months ago - 138 pages of scary but fascinating findings.  
  
As the author wrote, the analysis and the security issues described are purely hypothetical - because it's a nuclear reactor! The mind-blowing fact for me was that someone can buy nuclear plant equipment on eBay. Crazy - and quite alarming.  
  
Please enjoy the read and spread the word - offensive security research has officially come to nuclear plants.
