Wildfire - Record browser actions then replay immediately. Craft your own custom automation workflows. The Wildfire extension allows you to record your actions on the pages you visit, then replay those actions using a simulator. When actions are recorded or simulated, it produces a log which can be reviewed. You can then use the Workflow Editor to manipulate the behavior of the simulation. The extension is appropriate for those using similar automation extensions such as iMacros or for software testers using tools such as Selenium.: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wildfire/djhgeeodemlfdpmcccdekfalbhllcoim?hl=en
