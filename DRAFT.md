# Description

In video veritas, if we divert the old Latin saying: In video, there is truth! The digital media revolution and the convergence of social media with broadband wired and wireless connectivity are bringing breaking news to online video platforms; and, news organisations delivering information by Web streams and TV broadcast often rely on user-generated recordings of breaking and developing news events shared by social media to illustrate the story. However, in video there is also deception. Access to increasingly sophisticated editing and content management tools, and the ease in which fake information spreads in electronic networks requires reputable news outlets to carefully verify third-party content before publishing it, reducing their ability to break news quickly while increasing costs in times of tight budgets. ```InVID``` will build a platform providing services to detect, authenticate and check the reliability and accuracy of newsworthy video files and video content spread via social media.**: https://www.invid-project.eu/
