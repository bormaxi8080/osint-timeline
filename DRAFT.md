In essence, what I'm trying to do now is combine the deadly accuracy of facts with the beauty of good writing and impressions. Serve the most terrible things in such a way that they not only pound, but also make you think - so that through and through. Connect the horror and beauty of the world. I've always wanted it, I've always wanted it. For me, this is the most important thing. It looks like it's starting to work.
