**New from GitHub Community:**

Sampled Maximal Marginal Relevance (SMMR) is a new method from scientists at T-Bank AI Research that allows up to 10% faster and more diverse formation of recommendations in online services. Instead of the same relevant object, SMMR uses a probabilistic sample from a limited number of candidates. According to the results of the study: the new method turned out to be 2-10 times faster than MMR and DPP and at the same time provided an increase in the diversity of recommendations by 5-10%: https://github.com/kliakhnovich/smmr
