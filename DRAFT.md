“Deeds should be worshiped, not statues. Or maybe you don’t even need to be worshiped by deeds. Because everyone does what is in his power. One is a revolution, the other is a whistle. Maybe I only have enough strength for one whistle , so what am I - shit now?..” 
(A. and B. Strugatsky, “The Doomed City”)
