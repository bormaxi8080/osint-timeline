Whoever throws a stone at us,
We will beat him with bread:

He will eat our bread,
He will drink our wine,
Until he is sated to the full,
Until his belly grows heavy,
Until his limbs grow soft,
Until his eyes are covered with a cloudy film of satiety,
And his hand can no longer lift a stone.

And then the elder will rise and say:

Eat, eat, little brother,
And go to bed.
There will be no more hunger.
Tomorrow it will rain.


First, corporations cut staff, cut expenses on testing, infrastructure, monitoring and other costs. At the same time, all sorts of managers scream about a global crisis on the market, write out million-dollar bonuses for themselves and walk off into the sunset in a white coat. And then this happens.


If everyone around you lies and sells instead of making things, it means that the point of no return has already been passed. The world is going crazy and brutal - and marketing, accordingly, too. Modern marketing breeds savagery and hatred. Society accumulates bitterness, and sooner or later it results in something. It can't help but result. In Russia - in universal "vatnik" and "greatness", in America - in a psychopath with a torn-off ear.
