I just love colors: colored tattoos, rings and bracelets with enamel, moments indelible from life, freedom, warmth, wind, salt, tequila and lemon - as the last joy, sleep in the morning, silver, films about the future, birds with their fanning on all my life with a wave of wings - feathers on the cheeks, butterflies - admiring their essence and photography, words, balcony cigarettes, meaninglessness, wastelessness and hopelessness. May those be merciful, wonderful and beautiful, to whom you are merciful, wonderful and beautiful yourself. That's all.

Bellingcat's Investigative Tech Team ran an in person workshop on methods for archiving online content. The team outlined why backing up online data is important and provided a demo on Bellingcat’s auto archiver tool. You can learn more about the tool here: [https://atlos.org/](https://atlos.org/)

Atlos is a non-profit platform used by investigators to catalog and verify eyewitness media at scale. Atlos is specialized to the needs of visual investigations: The platform automatically archives source media and implements industry-standard researcher safety measures by default. While other systems are dedicated collaborative tools or databases, Atlos does both. Atlos powers Bellingcat's sprawling investigation into civilian harm in Ukraine: https://github.com/atlosdotorg/atlos
