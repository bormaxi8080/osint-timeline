Outside the window, a river Human voices Diligent hopelessness Softness of ice No inevitability of death No definitions of love


You are made of the stones of those fortresses, that were once razed to the ground. I fear that even this short communication will change my character, my former lightness will be replaced by gloom. It is better for us to separately each perform our own suerte de muerte!

How OSINT shaped reporting on the war in Ukraine: https://www.info-res.org/eyes-on-russia/articles/how-osint-shaped-reporting-on-the-war-in-ukraine/

Russian company working with the state promises $4 million for hacking Telegram. Operation Zero (OOO Matrix) is based in St. Petersburg and is run by a certain Sergey Zelenyuk. He has previously stated that his company resells vulnerabilities only in countries “not part of NATO.” The company’s website states that it cooperates with Russian state companies. Unlike traditional bug bounty platforms like Hacker One or Bugcrowd, Operation Zero does NOT warn vendors about vulnerabilities in their products: https://theins.ru/news/279855

Cybersecurity researchers at Citizen Lab, a digital rights watchdog based at the University of Toronto, have exposed the use of a highly sophisticated spyware tool named Graphite.
