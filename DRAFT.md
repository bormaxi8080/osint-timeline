Pine forest, sun, almost summer.
- Cuckoo, cuckoo, how old am I?..
I think it's 12.
- Something’s not enough... Let’s do it again?..
I think. 12.
- Yes, in our lifetime, a year or two... Still not enough. Maybe you can add more?..
I think. 12. And one more, with a pause.
- How stubborn... Well, okay, we’ll live to see fifty, and then we’ll see. The cuckoo is not the last, after all.


The courtyards of Slavyansk. Three yards, a gypsy baron lives, all in gold and with shepherds. White pouring, grind the house to my grandmother, pull out cold juice from the basement, grandmother with a wet rag and a cry "Oh, you have a lousy nasty thing!" - Because you stomp the bed, and after 15 minutes you are drawn to strawberries together. With my grandfather to swim, to catch the fish on the red estuary, but you gobbled up the bread for the bait without reaching the estuary, because it is tasty. The mulberry on the soles of the sandals, and again a grandmother with a wet towel, because you smear the floorboards ... Through the road - the library in the recreation center of the railway workers, and the aunt Lida works there. And in the evening, in the wasteland, between the house of Aunt Lida and the House of Culture, we burn a fire and bake potatoes.

Slavyansk, Artem Street.


A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.


The ceiling of the lower world is almost always the bottom of the upper.

The draft UN Cybercrime Agreement Agreement opens the way to total surveillance. International human rights organizations expressed serious concerns about the current version of the UN Cybercrime draft draft version. At the upcoming negotiations, it is planned to approve a document that, according to activists, will strengthen the surveillance and criminalization of journalists, human rights activists, children and representatives of civil society around the world: https://roskomsvoboda.org/ru/post/dogovor-oon-o-kiberprestup-vvodit-slezhku/
