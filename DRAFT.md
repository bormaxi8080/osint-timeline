WirelessPentesting-CheatSheet - This repository was originally made as a CheatSheet for OSWP Examination by Offensive Security. With the time, Offensive Security made an second version of OSWP that i haven't taken. As I'm adding sometimes Wireless Pentesting contents that I didn't learned from OSWP, and as i don't know the newest content of OSWP, I'm changing this repository as "WirelessPentesting-CheatSheet" instead of "OSWP-CheatSheet": https://github.com/V0lk3n/WirelessPentesting-CheatSheet
