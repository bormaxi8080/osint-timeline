I'm like a chronicle. I'm like Chthon. I've always been like this. Serebryansky forest. Verdun. Tin cans with nails. Optical fiber getting into flour.

Hunchly. It's a good old tool that's worth reminding once again:

- save the pages you visit (text, screenshots, path to opening)
- extract "juicy info" (email, IPs, Tor links and MUCH more + use your own regex)
- make notes, to-do lists
- generate reports
