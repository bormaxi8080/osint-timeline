...High in the mountains there is an Air Lake. The water in it is like a white dream - clean, transparent and cold. The bottom is not visible - only last year's brown leaves on the stones leading into the depths, a reflection of the past rain, a rainbow on the surface and three hundred year old cedars along the banks.
The lake is silent. Anyone who decides to swim in it becomes a child for a few minutes. So the Lake teaches people to laugh. The more good a person has done for others, the funnier and easier it is for him.



Be sure to look. The patriotic faces of these juveniles, not obscured by morality, are still motherfc..ers, under the leadership of motherfc..ers already adults, are creating state fascism and censorship.

But, in fact, what grows out of juvenile motherf..ers: these motherfuc..ers are already adults and deserve special attention. Here is the website (tyts: https://internet-rozysk.rf/), and Facebook and VK groups (tyts: https://www.facebook.com/internet.rozysk/, tyts: https://vk. com/internet.rozysk), and a channel in a cart with twenty-five thousand subscribers (tyts: https://t.me/irozysk), or rather, a whole network of channels with bots, a system for tracking users, identifying numbers, locations, connecting to SORM, friendship with various influential Russian bodies, a blog with letters from them, and so on and so forth. And all this is loudly called OSINT, although in fact it is an ordinary Comrade Major. In general, the guys are serious, and they should also be dealt with seriously, with the involvement of serious resources.
