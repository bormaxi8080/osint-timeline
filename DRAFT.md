I never believe when someone says about another that everything is always good and easy for him. I don't believe myself when the same thing seems about someone. I just know it's not. The most positive and bright people always have more scars in their souls and on their hands than on the same hands of fingers. That is why they shine so brightly for others. They are good and easy.


I loved this city. For greenery and warmth. And for human diversity: only in human forbs and in motion, in fact, the city remains alive. Many different things arise and much of the past remains in you, heals, and only in this way the hatred and fear of a person without a homeland gradually disappear: even if a person is not a brother to a person, then at least he is no longer a thief or a murderer. Even a neighbor whom another neighbor calls exclusively Hitler)
And walk more, look around, walk until your legs hurt: it really heals. Only on the go, physically something worthwhile and good is said and written.
