Dystopia.

A team of workers catches chickens at night. The work is brought to the farm in the evening; after dark, a couple thousand chickens need to be caught and loaded into trucks. The chickens are caught in the dark and stuffed into iron crates. Naturally, they resist, trying to escape, scratching the catchers. But the shadows in the night are diligent and merciless. By morning, the pen is empty, and young chickens are released into it. During the day, the catchers drink heavily, but not out of pity for the unfortunate chickens headed for slaughter. But simply out of boredom...

What does “jurisdictional coverage” really mean for Tesari?

🔺  Local specialists vs Built-in jurisdiction knowledge

"Organizations often rely on local experts to support regional investigations. Tesari natively understands jurisdiction-specific nuances --> not to replace experts, but to narrow down and clarify the subject of interest."

🔺 Language barriers vs Local-language intelligence

"Language gaps often lead to missed or misinterpreted information.

Tesari searches in local languages and validates findings in context."

🔺 Fragmented data sources vs One investigative workspace

"Global investigations usually require expensive and complex combinations of local and international databases (10+ sources).

Tesari integrates these sources into a single, unified investigation flow, making it a one-stop shop for cross-border research."

🔺  Manual regulation and geopolitical analysis vs Contextual validation

"Investigators must understand local regulations and geopolitics to detect misinformation.

Tesari understands local specifics and flags potential disinformation, enabling investigators to validate information faster and more consistently"

🔺  Hard-to-reach regions vs Built-in access

"Some regions remain inaccessible or extremely difficult to research.

Tesari covers the most restricted jurisdictions like China and Russia. Expanding further is a matter of time."

Jurisdictional coverage isn’t about more data --> It’s about seeing clearly.

BROWSER SANDBOXES  
  
There are situations when you want to visit a website, but you are not sure about its reliability, or you do not want to share your unique browser fingerprinting with the site, or simply something is not working in your browser and you want to try if it will work in another one.  
  
In this case, you can visit the website in a browser sandbox. Here are a few examples of such services (some of them are free and some are partially free)
