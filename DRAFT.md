I just love colors: colored tattoos, rings and bracelets with enamel, moments indelible from life, freedom, warmth, wind, salt, tequila and lemon - as the last joy, sleep in the morning, silver, films about the future, birds with their fanning on all my life with a wave of wings - feathers on the cheeks, butterflies - admiring their essence and photography, words, balcony cigarettes, meaninglessness, wastelessness and hopelessness. May those be merciful, wonderful and beautiful, to whom you are merciful, wonderful and beautiful yourself. That's all.
