Whoever throws a stone at us,
We will beat him with bread:

He will eat our bread,
He will drink our wine,
Until he is sated to the full,
Until his belly grows heavy,
Until his limbs grow soft,
Until his eyes are covered with a cloudy film of satiety,
And his hand can no longer lift a stone.

And then the elder will rise and say:

Eat, eat, little brother,
And go to bed.
There will be no more hunger.
Tomorrow it will rain.
