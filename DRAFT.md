There is a lot of snow in Almaty. I shoveled the yard for a whole hour today, and my boys had a fair amount of time left too. They will take it out in a wheelbarrow: exercise in the fresh air, so to speak. Moderate exercise.
  
And so you shovel the yard and realize this: everything that comes to us from life is falling from the sky. Sometimes it’s free, like this snow, sometimes it’s not. And it goes into the ground.
