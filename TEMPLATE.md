**Week of 30 January — 6 February 2026**

Every week, I manually curate tools, research, and services that are genuinely useful for OSINT, digital investigations, security research, and adjacent fields.

No hype. No SEO noise. No "AI startups that change everything".  
Only things you can **open, verify, and actually use**.

## 🧭 Featured Project

### **Tesari — OSINT Copilot**

> A first step for investigations into organized crime, corruption, trafficking, and global risk networks.

Tesari is designed as an entry point into complex investigations: structure, context, and navigable intelligence instead of chaotic searching.
