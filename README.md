### Draft:


...The cat brought us kittens yesterday. Already big, two whites and a fiery red fluffy. Already grown up savages and do not allow themselves to be photographed yet.
And I thought that this is how the world should be. Grill barbecue, tame cats, grow flowers and greens in the yard. No rat pack. Without evil spirits. Without vk, mailru and yandex. Without all these Usmanov-Prilepin-Konashenkov-Prigozhin. Without parades and "colorado" covens.
This is worth living and working for.
