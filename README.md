### Draft:

...I imagined here: you wake up in the morning, look at the monitors, and there is a nebula in the constellation Canis Major, 15 thousand light years from the Earth. A tough day ahead: wake up the crew, explore a couple of planetary systems, sort out navigation, send out reports...

The great science fiction writers were right: the essence should not even be in ourselves, but only in what we can become in ten, a hundred, a thousand years - in order to realize what the great science fiction writers thought about.

That's when God is very close.

And in the meantime, we are all about war, money and braces...

Tools:

Katana - A next-generation crawling and spidering framework: https://github.com/projectdiscovery/katana

eNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications with a focus on highly configurable streamlined recon process via Engines, recon data correlation and organization, continuous monitoring, backed by a database, and simple yet intuitive User Interface. reNgine makes it easy for penetration testers to gather reconnaissance withâ€¦

Fast and lightweight, UDPX is a single-packet UDP scanner written in Go that supports the discovery of over 45 services with the ability to add custom ones. It is easy to use and portable, and can be run on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows. Unlike internet-wide scanners like zgrab2 and zmap, UDPX is designed for portability and ease of use: https://github.com/nullt3r/udpx

The Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools,
implemented in Python under the GNU General Public License, for the
extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.
The extraction techniques are performed completely independent of the
system being investigated but offer visibilty into the runtime state
of the system. The framework is intended to introduce people to the
techniques and complexities associated with extracting digital artifacts
from volatile memory samples and provide a platform for further work into
this exciting area of research: https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility
