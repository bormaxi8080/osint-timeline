Live as you would not be ashamed if you lived to old age, do not shine to anyone if you cannot, but shine to your own, shine and sanctify to those and those whom you really love.

An n-gram is a collection of n successive items in a text document that may include words, numbers, symbols, and punctuation. N-gram models are useful in many text analytics applications where sequences of words are relevant, such as in sentiment analysis, text classification, and text generation. N-gram modeling is one of the many techniques used to convert text from an unstructured format to a structured format. An alternative to n-gram is word embedding techniques, such as [word2vec](https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/word2vec.html): https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/ngram.html
