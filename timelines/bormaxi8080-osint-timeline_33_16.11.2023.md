It is good to be a little boy when you are only 7-8 years old: the first snow, and you are in the snow, and snow - on the street, snow is everywhere, snow around, in boots, behind the collapse of snow and under the jacket is also snow. Eyeles, and you can sing a voiced voice to the whole yard about snow. The old courtyard, you are all in the snow, and the porch in the snow, and on the threshold, and in the apartment, the grandmother is waiting and preparing pancakes in a stalling pan, and mom is still alive, and dad is alive, and you do not drink and do not smoke, and you no longer Almost 44, and in your own entrance you have not yet been stabbed, and there is nothing more at all: neither war, nor this is all... only snow. 

Right now in 1988 winter.
