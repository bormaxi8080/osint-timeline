```The black market of drugs and precursors``` is something really special. Ilya Shumanov contributed as an investigator to a new BBC investigation exposing how chemical precursors from ```China reach the Russian market``` and are used for industrial production of mephedrone distributed through darkweb. He traced key routes through Vladivostok and Kazakhstan, documented nearly a ton of seized precursors, and identified typical masking tactics — from false customs declarations to re-registration via shell companies. The findings show that flows remain industrial in scale, while authorities deliberately look the other way: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5wajKa4iz8&feature=youtu.be

```Ubikron Advanced Enrichments List```. One of Ubikron's many useful features is the ability to extract well-known entities from web pages, use it as input, and send it to a range of online tools. For example, Ubikron extracts emails, phone numbers, and usernames from web pages and generates links to quickly search on IntelX, Epieos and others. And... users can also add their own extractions (using regular expressions) and enrichments (using URLs with GET parameters). With this in mind, we finally finished building this page. It's a huge additional enrichments for Ubikron and can be found at this repository: https://github.com/ubikron/Advanced-Enrichments
