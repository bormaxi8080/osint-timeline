### bormaxi8080 OSINT Timeline (92) - 09.01.2025:

NONSENSE

As long as, as long as, in the black yard,

the geese of time chased the holy children

and with pink heels in sawdust and resin

these children ran and sang le-le-le.

But no one could get out beyond the sharp picket fence,

as long as - prick, prick, prick.

The geese of time chased the holy children

in the black, in the black, in the black yard.

The children trampled their heels into the chewing black earth

and mommy, and daddy, and granny with the pig.

And they themselves lay down there under the heels of their

newly born children and cursed them.

The geese of time chase, chase everyone and everything.

And the earth watches, watches with greedy eyes.
