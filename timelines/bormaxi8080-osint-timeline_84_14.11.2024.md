### bormaxi8080 OSINT Timeline (84) - 14.11.2024:

If everyone around you lies and sells instead of making things, it means that the point of no return has already been passed. The world is going crazy and brutal - and marketing, accordingly, too. Modern marketing breeds savagery and hatred. Society accumulates bitterness, and sooner or later it results in something. It can't help but result. In Russia - in universal "vatnik" and "greatness", in America - in a psychopath with a torn-off ear.
