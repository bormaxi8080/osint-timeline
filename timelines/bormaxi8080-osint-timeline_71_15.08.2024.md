Pine forest, sun, almost summer.

- Cuckoo, cuckoo, how old am I?..
I think it's 12.
- Something’s not enough... Let’s do it again?..
I think. 12.
- Yes, in our lifetime, a year or two... Still not enough. Maybe you can add more?..
I think. 12. And one more, with a pause.
- How stubborn... 

Well, okay, we’ll live to see fifty, and then we’ll see. The cuckoo is not the last, after all.
