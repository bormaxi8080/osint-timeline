I just love colors: colored tattoos, rings and bracelets with enamel, moments indelible from life, freedom, warmth, wind, salt, tequila and lemon - as the last joy, sleep in the morning, silver, films about the future, birds with their fanning on all my life with a wave of wings - feathers on the cheeks, butterflies - admiring their essence and photography, words, balcony cigarettes, meaninglessness, wastelessness and hopelessness. May those be merciful, wonderful and beautiful, to whom you are merciful, wonderful and beautiful yourself. That's all.

```ATLOS``` is being used by The Global Authentication Project to manage our data and community. For those interested, visit [atlos.org/waitlist](http://atlos.org/waitlist)  
  
Bellingcat's Investigative Tech Team ran an in person workshop on methods for archiving online content. The team outlined why backing up online data is important and provided a demo on Bellingcat’s auto archiver tool. You can learn more about the tool here: [https://atlos.org/](https://atlos.org/)

ATLOS is a non-profit platform used by investigators to catalog and verify eyewitness media at scale. AtLOS is specialized to the needs of visual investigations: The platform automatically archives source media and implements industry-standard researcher safety measures by default. While other systems are dedicated collaborative tools or databases, Atlos does both. Atlos powers Bellingcat's sprawling investigation into civilian harm in Ukraine: https://github.com/atlosdotorg/atlos
