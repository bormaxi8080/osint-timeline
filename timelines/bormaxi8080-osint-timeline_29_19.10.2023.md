Some things are not random at all.

In 2016 I got a medical tattoo. Any doctor knows about this: your blood type is written on your shoulder and information is indicated that you do not mind being a donor of your organs. Well, if anything...

I don't know why I did it. I didn’t have any premonition, I just decided to do it for some reason and that’s all. Besides, that's so beautiful... )

But when I was stabbed in the stomach by a deputy, already on the operating table the doctor wanted to test my blood type: I needed an urgent transfusion. I just showed him the tattoo on my shoulder, and he didn’t do the analysis right away, wait and waste time. Perhaps this saved me. At least in particular.

The doctor was Kazakh, by the way.

I believe in such things. Not by chance and in general.

The ```ACLED``` Early Warning Dashboard offers an array of interactive and interconnected tools for tracking political violence and demonstrations around the world. As an extensively customizable hub, the Dashboard streamlines analysis of emerging trends in a way that can be tailored to the needs of each user, from global researchers monitoring violent hotspots across regions to country analysts looking for granular detail on unrest in a specific subnational area. Identify important changes in political violence and demonstrations across and within countries, situate this activity within historical contexts, and spot early warning signs like the emergence of new conflict actors - all in one place: https://acleddata.com/early-warning/

Automated Retrieval of ACLED Conflict Event Data: https://github.com/cran/acled.api

ACLED Data Science Laboratory: https://github.com/heltmulig/acled-project

```Armed Conflict Data``` - Creates a data pipeline from the Armed Conflict Location Event Data (ACLED) with the intent that users can obtain data to validate conflict models: https://github.com/projectmesadata/armedconflict

```Netlas CookBook``` - The goal of this guide is very simple - to teach anyone interested in cyber security, regardless of their knowledge level, how to make the most of Netlas.io: https://github.com/netlas-io/netlas-cookbook

A list of useful payloads and bypass for Web Application Security and Pentest/CTF: https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings

----

```cloudgrep``` is grep for cloud storage: https://github.com/cado-security/cloudgrep

```git-scanner``` - A tool for bug hunting or pentesting for targeting websites that have open .git repositories available in public: https://github.com/HightechSec/git-scanner

```Alfred``` is a advanced OSINT information gathering tool that finds social media accounts based on inputs: https://github.com/Alfredredbird/alfred

```MetadataParser``` is a Python module for pulling metadata out of web documents: https://github.com/jvanasco/metadata_parser

```fetchmeurls``` - A Tool for Bug Bounty Hunters that uses Passive and Active Techniques to fetch URLs as a strong Recon, so you can then create Attack Vectors (XSS, Nuclei, SQLi etc...): https://github.com/blackhatethicalhacking/fetchmeurls

```TBomb``` - SMS And Call Bomber For Linux And Termux: https://github.com/TheSpeedX/TBomb

```BaseCrack``` is a tool written in Python that can decode all alphanumeric base encoding schemes. This tool can accept single user input, multiple inputs from a file, input from argument, **multi-encoded bases**, **bases in image EXIF data**, **bases on images with OCR** and decode them incredibly fast: https://github.com/mufeedvh/basecrack

```WCamPhish``` - Grab cam shots from target's phone front camera or PC webcam just sending a link: https://github.com/Tanmay-Tiwaricyber/WcamPhish

```WiFi Passview``` is an open-source batch script-based program that can recover your WiFi Password easily in seconds. This is for Windows OS only. Basically, this scripted program has the same function as other passview software such as webpassview and mailpassview: https://github.com/warengonzaga/wifi-passview

```WiFiCrack``` demonstrates of some of the security flaws associated with WPA(2) networks by demonstrating simple and efficient cracking. It captures the necessary Wi-Fi packets associated with with WPA(2) handshakes and then utilises [hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat) to attempt to extract the hashed passkey: https://github.com/phenotypic/WiFiCrack

```DamnWebScanner``` - Another web vulnerabilities scanner, this extension works on Chrome and Opera: https://github.com/swisskyrepo/DamnWebScanner

```MARA``` is a Mobile Application Reverse engineering and Analysis Framework. It is a toolkit that puts together commonly used mobile application reverse engineering and analysis tools to assist in testing mobile applications against the OWASP mobile security threats: https://github.com/xtiankisutsa/MARA_Framework

```Pythem``` is a multi-purpose pentest framework written in Python. It has been developed to be used by security researchers and security professionals: https://github.com/m4n3dw0lf/pythem

```BSF (Botnet Simulation Framework)``` provides a discrete simulation environment to implement and extend peer-to-peer botnets, tweak their settings and allow defenders to evaluate monitoring and countermeasures: https://github.com/tklab-tud/BSF

```HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver (HEVD)``` - Windows & Linux: https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver

```GivingStorm``` - The beginnings of a C2 framework. Currently without all the C2 stuff so far. Generates a dual stage VBS infection vector, and a dual stage HTA infection vector. The variables take into account C2 addresses, Koadic/Empire payloads, and a few delivery mechanisms. The payload files are output to an aptly named directory "Payloads" that is created if not already present: https://github.com/LiveGray/GIVINGSTORM
