When the Israelites, led by Moses, began to grumble against God during their wanderings in the desert, God sent poisonous snakes to attack them. Many of the Israelites died from the bites of these snakes. At the request of the people, Moses prayed, and God commanded him to make a copper snake and raise it on a pole. Anyone who was bitten by a snake and looked at the copper snake survived.
