### bormaxi8080 OSINT Timeline (86) - 28.11.2024:

Whoever throws a stone at us,
We will beat him with bread:

He will eat our bread,
He will drink our wine,
Until he is sated to the full,
Until his belly grows heavy,
Until his limbs grow soft,
Until his eyes are covered with a cloudy film of satiety,
And his hand can no longer lift a stone.

And then the elder will rise and say:

Eat, eat, little brother,
And go to bed.
There will be no more hunger.
Tomorrow it will rain.

Sometimes it can be difficult to determine if photos taken at different ages belong to the same person. In such a situation, this tool will help: https://6mzld2.csb.app

If reverse facial photo search did not yield results, try processing the photo with AI age filter and add 10-20 years. Here are some examples of tools:
