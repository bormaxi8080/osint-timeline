A software bug in the glibc library allows system privileges to be elevated to root level. The problem affects at least Ubuntu, Fedora and Debian. Most likely, other distributions are also vulnerable: https://safe.cnews.ru/news/top/2024-02-01_kriticheskij_bag_v_fundamentalnoj

```Fuzztruction``` is an academic prototype of a fuzzer that does not directly mutate inputs (as most fuzzers do) but instead uses a so-called generator application to produce an input for our fuzzing target. As programs generating data usually produce the correct representation, our fuzzer _mutates_ the generator program (by injecting faults), such that the data produced is _almost_ valid. Optimally, the produced data passes the parsing stages in our fuzzing target, called _consumer_, but triggers unexpected behavior in deeper program logic. This allows to even fuzz targets that utilize cryptography primitives such as encryption or message integrity codes. The main advantage of our approach is that it generates complex data without requiring heavyweight program analysis techniques, grammar approximations, or human intervention: https://github.com/fuzztruction/fuzztruction
