Regarding the analysis of data and the analysis of disinformation in social networks. The trouble for many journalists now is not even fact-checking, but their possession of technology at a level sufficient to quickly identify misinformation online. Well, that is, they know how to broadcast and present information, but they cannot master complex equipment. Well, coordination and mutual support, of course.

To have at least some idea of the complexity of the technique that is used for such analysis, you can see a recent article on hate speech analysis in Telegram by Benjamin Strick ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/bendobrown/ )

Incitement to Kill: Tracking hate speech targeting Ukrainians during Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine, tyts: https://www.info-res.org/post/incitement-to-kill-tracking-hate-speech-targeting-ukrainians-during-russia-s-war-in-ukraine

In order to work with such, you need a lot of experience and even more great awareness.
Well, a couple of thousands of utilities with which such data is collected.

```Telegram Keyword Trends``` - an analysis tool to explore the emergence of hatespeech, disinformation, and narratives of interest on the Telegram chat platform.

And that's just a drop in the ocean...
