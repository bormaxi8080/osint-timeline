...My homeland is Uncle Bakhyt in the village of Kyzyl-Tau, burning sun, wide steppe and beshparmak. This is football with a rubber ball or on a bike to the Nura River. Falcon nests on dried poplars, herds of red cows. This is homeland. Homeland flowering chestnuts in 2000 near Zhytomyr. Apple orchard. We are walking through the village of Polyanki, and the girls are laughing after us? Beautiful girls by the way. I remember one surname was Saint. She really stepped off the icon. I remember how we sat on the shore of a pond in the village of Baranivka and prayed for the Russian sailors on the Kursk.

I met my homeland on a Polish forest path not far from Krakow. She was the color of a salamander that crawled out to bask in the sun after a long rain. There was a homeland in the Tomsk taiga, where we went to shoot remote villages, and there I caught a 4 kg bream. Old huts on the Moscow highway. The hard labor path along which the Decembrists passed. Homeland Tobolsk Kremlin with its dungeons. And bear tracks by the car in which we spent the night with a gentle beauty. In 2008, the German bar was home. It's hot, June, and we unfamiliar Dutchmen support European football together. The Indian nuns who came to help the homeless in Siberia was my homeland. In amateur performances and in conversations until midnight. At dawn over the Ob.

And now she's gone. There is no my homeland. Part of her cries and suffers. The other part is crazy, Nazi, fighting. This part is ruled by bastards that are bombing the Zhytomyr region with its chestnuts. Guards who promise six years in the camps for calling everything by its proper name. There is, for example, General Kartapolov, who in 2014 was in charge of Bukami, who shot down a Dutch plane. So he just asks for 6 years to everyone who dares to blurt something against their homeland. This is his home. He is so accustomed, they are so accustomed. Instill love in yourself with a stick and a camp. Let them live in their homeland. Let them plant each other. Scribbling denunciations. I don't fucking need her. I took my homeland with me.
