...And it was given to people: 

Conscience, so that he himself exposes his shortcomings; 
Strength so that he can overcome them; 
Intelligence and Kindness are for the benefit of oneself and those around oneself, for only that good is that which benefits one’s neighbors; 
A woman, so that his family may not cease and prosper; 
Friend, so that he knows the extent of his goodness and sacrifice in the name of his neighbor;
Fatherland, so that he would have something to serve and something to lay down his head for;
Rye, so that by the sweat of his brow he could obtain His Bread, as the Lord commanded him;
Vineyards, Gardens, Herds and other goods, so that you have something to give to your neighbors; 
and the whole World, so that there would be a place to accomplish all this and pay tribute to that great love that was his Lord God. 
And as was said here, so everything was done. Faith and the law of the fathers filled the flesh and spirit of man with love. And a handsome and splendid young man was a judge over the people and ruled over them. Not being a man in the flesh, he was, however, a human spirit, living in the depths of the soul and entering into all its components. 

And that faith gave birth to reason, wisdom and insight into the essence of things.
