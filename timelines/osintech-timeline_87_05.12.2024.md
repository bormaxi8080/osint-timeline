"First Department" reported the discovery of an infection of an anti-war activist's phone with the ```Monokle spyware``` from the Russian FSB

The human rights project "First Department" reported on the infection of the devices of the anti-war activist with Russian citizenship Kirill Porubets with the Monokle spyware, developed by the St. Petersburg company "Special Technology Center" (STC). This is the first time that human rights activists have learned of the use of this program against anti-war Russians, claims "First Department".

As "First Department" explained to The Insider, so far only Android devices are known to be infected. However, the possibility of installing it on iOS is not excluded and is being studied.

Porubets managed to leave Russia after being detained by special services and threatened with treason.
