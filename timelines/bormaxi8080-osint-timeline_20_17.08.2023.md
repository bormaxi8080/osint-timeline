I loved this city. For greenery and warmth. And for human diversity: only in human forbs and in motion, in fact, the city remains alive. Many different things arise and much of the past remains in you, heals, and only in this way the hatred and fear of a person without a homeland gradually disappear: even if a person is not a brother to a person, then at least he is no longer a thief or a murderer. Even a neighbor whom another neighbor calls exclusively Hitler)
And walk more, look around, walk until your legs hurt: it really heals. Only on the go, physically something worthwhile and good is said and written.
