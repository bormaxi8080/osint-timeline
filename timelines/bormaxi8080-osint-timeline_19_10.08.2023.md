A court in Novosibirsk sentenced 67-year-old pensioner Takhir Arslanov to three years in a penal colony because of comments on VKontakte. Grandfather with 50 years of experience, including at defense enterprises, received a pension of 14 thousand rubles, then at midnight he was searched, during which law enforcement officers killed his cat. The prosecution asked for six years.  
  
Before the meeting, local independent MP Svetlana Kaverzina asked if there were any animals left to look after. Arslanov answered: "THERE WAS A CAT, THEY KILL HER DURING THE SEARCH":
